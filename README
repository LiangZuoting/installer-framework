The Qt Installer Framework provides a set of tools and utilities to create
installers for the supported desktop Qt platforms: Linux, Microsoft Windows, and
macOS.


Documentation
--------------------------

The binary packages for the Qt Installer Framework include documentation in the
doc directory. The documentation is also available online at
    https://doc.qt.io/qtinstallerframework/index.html

Notes
--------------------------

To build an installer, it is advised to use a statically linked Qt (5.12.7 or
newer). The tested and supported Qt version is 5.12.7.

See the documentation at
    https://doc.qt.io/qtinstallerframework/ifw-getting-started.html

Getting Help
--------------------------

If you think you found a bug, please report it to

https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTIFW

General questions are best asked on interest@qt-project.org.

Customization
--------------------------

Use vs2019 to organize and build projects.

All *.sln and *.vcxproj files generate automatically with installerfw.pro.

Additionally, I change installer project from static lib to dll, to avoid reference to source code of Qt. So now I can use offical dlls of Qt to build QtIFW, it should be work.
